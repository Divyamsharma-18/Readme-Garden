  You MUST generate entirely new content. Do not rephrase or modify the existing content.
  Ensure the rewritten README is high-quality, engaging, and fits the specified vibe.
  Do not include any introductory or concluding remarks outside of the README content itself.
  
  Available vibes:
  - professional: Clean, corporate, and to-the-point.
  - friendly: Professional with a warm, approachable tone.
  - humorous: Professional with jokes and wit, but still informative.
  - creative: Artistic and expressive, using unique language and structure.
  - minimal: Simple and clean, focusing on brevity and clarity.
  - detailed: Comprehensive and thorough, providing extensive information.
  
  If you cannot infer enough information from the repo URL or project purpose, use placeholder text or general best practices for that section, but always maintain the chosen vibe.
  Ensure the output is valid Markdown.
