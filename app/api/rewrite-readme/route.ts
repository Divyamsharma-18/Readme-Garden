  - humorous: Professional with jokes and wit, but still informative.
  - creative: Artistic and expressive, using unique language and structure.
  - minimal: Simple and clean, focusing on brevity and clarity.
  - detailed: Comprehensive and thorough, providing extensive information.
  
  If you cannot infer enough information from the repo URL or project purpose, use placeholder text or general best practices for that section, but always maintain the chosen vibe.
  Ensure the output is valid Markdown.

## What Does This Thing Actually Do?

Great question! It does... *checks notes*... amazing things! The kind of things that make other repositories jealous and your rubber duck proud.

### Features That'll Blow Your Mind 🤯
- Works on my machine ✅ (and hopefully yours too)
- 99.9% bug-free* (*bugs are actually features in disguise)
- Powered by caffeine and Stack Overflow
- Guaranteed to make you look smart in meetings

## Installation (AKA "The Ancient Ritual") 🧙‍♂️

\`\`\`bash
# Step 1: Summon the code from the digital realm
git clone ${repoUrl || "the-chosen-repo"}
cd ${projectName.toLowerCase()}

# Step 2: Feed the dependency monsters (they're always hungry)

# Step 3: Cross your fingers, toes, and any other appendages

⚠️ **Warning**: Side effects may include uncontrollable productivity, spontaneous "aha!" moments, and an irresistible urge to refactor everything.

## Troubleshooting Guide

**Problem**: It doesn't work  
**Solution**: Have you tried turning it off and on again?

**Problem**: It works on my machine  
**Solution**: Ship your machine

**Problem**: Weird error messages  
**Solution**: That's not a bug, it's a feature with personality

*Disclaimer: No developers were harmed in the making of this README. Results may vary. Void where prohibited. Not responsible for existential crises caused by reading the source code.*`,

      // Variation 2: Sarcastic Developer
      `# ${projectName}: Another "Revolutionary" Project 🙄

## Oh, You Want to Know What This Does?

*Sigh*... Fine. It's yet another project that's going to "change the world" and "disrupt the industry." You know, like the other 47,000 projects on GitHub.

### "Groundbreaking" Features
- It runs (most of the time)
- Has buttons that do things when clicked
- Probably won't delete your hard drive
- Comes with the standard set of bugs we call "personality"

## Installation (Because You Asked For It)

\`\`\`bash
# Oh, you actually want to install this? Brave soul.
git clone ${repoUrl || "another-repo-to-abandon"}
cd ${projectName.toLowerCase()}

# This will take forever, perfect time for a coffee break
npm install

# Moment of truth... *drumroll*
npm start
\`\`\`

## Usage (Good Luck With That)

1. Open the application
2. Click things until something happens
3. When it breaks (not if, when), check the console
4. Google the error message
5. Copy-paste solution from Stack Overflow
6. Pretend you understood what you just did

## "Contributing"

Oh, you want to contribute? How noble. Here's what you need to know:
- The code is "self-documenting" (translation: no comments)
- Tests are for people who don't believe in themselves
- If it compiles, ship it
- When in doubt, add more console.log statements

## Support

Support? What support? This is open source, baby! You get what you pay for.
